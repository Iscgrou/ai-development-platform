## Implementation Notes

### Critical Security Considerations
1. All file paths must be validated and sanitized
2. Container execution must always use non-root users
3. Network access should be disabled by default
4. Resource limits must be strictly enforced
5. File system access must be strictly controlled
6. All operations must be logged for audit purposes

### Performance Considerations
1. Minimize container creation overhead
2. Optimize file transfer operations
3. Implement efficient cleanup procedures
4. Cache base images when possible
5. Reuse containers when safe to do so

### Reliability Considerations
1. Implement robust error recovery
2. Handle all edge cases in file operations
3. Ensure proper cleanup in all scenarios
4. Maintain system stability under load
5. Implement health checks and monitoring

This checklist focuses on the core functionality required for secure and reliable sandbox operations. Advanced features like dynamic environment selection, dependency management, Git operations, and test runner integration will be addressed in subsequent phases.
