```javascript
// Continuous Operation Cycle
async startOperation() {
    while (this.state.running) {
        await this.verifySystemHealth();
        await this.synchronizeComponents();
        await this.processPendingTasks();
        await this.performMaintenance();
    }
}
```

### 2. Agent Coordinator (src/core/agent-coordination.js)
- Problem recognition and analysis
- Task distribution
- Agent management
- Resource allocation
- Performance monitoring

Key implementations:
```javascript
// Problem Recognition System
async analyzeProblem(input) {
    const requirements = await this.nlpAnalyzer.parse(input);
    const patterns = await this.patternMatcher.findSimilarCases(requirements);
    const analysis = {
        complexity: this.assessComplexity(requirements, patterns),
        requiredSkills: this.identifyRequiredSkills(requirements),
        dependencies: this.analyzeDependencies(requirements)
    };
    return analysis;
}
```

### 3. Learning System (src/core/learning-system.js)
- Experience processing
- Pattern recognition
- Knowledge management
- Model adaptation
- Performance evaluation

Key implementations:
```javascript
// Continuous Learning Loop
async startLearning() {
    while (true) {
        const experiences = await this.collectExperiences();
        const patterns = this.identifyPatterns(experiences);
        await this.updateKnowledge(patterns);
        await this.adaptModels();
        await this.evaluatePerformance();
    }
}
```

### 4. Task Execution (src/core/task-execution.js)
- Task implementation
- Progress monitoring
- Error handling
- Resource management
- Result validation

Key implementations:
```javascript
// Task Execution Pipeline
async executeTask(task, agent) {
    const resources = await this.allocateResources(task);
    const execution = await this.setupExecution(task, agent, resources);
    const result = await this.implementTask(execution);
    await this.validateResult(result, task);
    return result;
}
```

### 5. Agent Implementation (src/core/agent.js)
- Individual agent behavior
- Task execution
- Learning capabilities
- Error handling
- Performance tracking

Key implementations:
```javascript
// Continuous Learning System
async learn() {
    while (this.state.status !== 'terminated') {
        const gaps = await this.assessKnowledgeGaps();
        const priority = this.determineLearningPriority(gaps);
        await this.performLearning(priority);
        await this.integrateNewKnowledge();
    }
}
```
